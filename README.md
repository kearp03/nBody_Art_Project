## Compiling and Running Code
The repository contains bash scripts to compile, or to compile and run the CUDA file. First you need to ensure the scripts have the right executable permissions:
```bash
chmod 755 compile.sh
chmod 755 compileRun.sh
```

Then, to compile, or to compile and run you would run the following commands:
```bash
# To compile
./compile.sh
# To compile and run
./compileRun.sh
```
